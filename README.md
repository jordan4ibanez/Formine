# fortran_thing
 I realized I never posted any fortran stuff to my github so here it is.

Also this is hand coded while looking at the glfw source code and docs so you'll have to excuse any mistakes.

### Install dependencies on fedora:
```
sudo dnf install gfortran openGL glfw-devel
```

This is using gfortran, gfortran is very buggy. This might be using some bugs which only come with gfortran. Test it in ifort for me to see where it is wrong.
