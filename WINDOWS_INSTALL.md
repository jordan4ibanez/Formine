### 1) Get the native gfortran compiler

(I use the equation.com one)
https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/

### 1) Get STB files

You need ``stb_image.h`` and ``stb_image_write.h``.

Put them into the src/bindings folder.

(probably will distribute them internally down the line)
